# CloseLidAutomate
*Automate your lid closed action based on Monitor count*


## The Problem  
I've recently started using an external monitor and when I do so, 
I'd like to keep my laptop lid closed. When I'm away from home though, 
I usually want to use my laptop alone, so, when the lid it's closed, I want the system to go in Sleep mode.  
I'm a lazy person though, and going into power saving settings every time is rather annoying.

## The Solution
An AutoHotKey Script that runs in background and detects when I'm connecting or removing other Screens, hence 
set the lid closed action for me automatically.

## Installation
Simply extract the zip archive and start the application. If you want to autostart the application at windows startup, 
you can create a shortcut to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp and you're good to go!
